# Autograph - Terms of Use and Critical Warnings

*This document is also available in [Dutch](TERMS_NL.md) and [French](TERMS_FR.md) for your convenience. However, the English version is the legally binding and enforceable text. In case of any discrepancies between translations, the English version prevails.*

## What This Software Does

Autograph is a macOS application that enables you to digitally sign documents using your Belgian eID card. These signatures are created using the 'Signature' certificate on your eID (not the 'Authentication' certificate), which means they are **non-repudiable** and **legally binding**.

## Critical Legal Warning

**This is not a toy or a convenience tool - this software creates real, legally enforceable signatures.**

Digital signatures created with your Belgian eID are legally equivalent to handwritten signatures under Belgian and EU law (eIDAS Regulation EU No 910/2014, Belgian Law of 21 July 2016, and Belgian Law of 9 July 2001). They are valid and binding wherever electronic signatures are accepted.

When you sign a document using Autograph, you are creating the same legal commitment as if you had signed it with a pen. This means:
- You can be held legally responsible for any document you sign
- You should never sign anything you haven't read and understood
- You should never sign anything you don't agree to
- You should never allow untrusted software to access your Signature certificate

**The authors of Autograph bear absolutely no responsibility for what you choose to sign. You are entirely responsible for your own digital signatures.**

## Privacy Considerations

Your Belgian eID signature certificate contains your **National Registry Number** (Rijksregisternummer / Num√©ro de Registre National) embedded in its metadata. This number will be visible to anyone who receives a document you've digitally signed - they can extract it from the signature data.

While your National Registry Number isn't secret (it appears on various official documents), it is considered sensitive personal information under GDPR. Once you sign a document, you cannot control who might extract this number from your signature. Think carefully before:
- Sending signed documents to people or organizations you don't trust
- Uploading signed documents to public websites
- Sharing signed documents on social media or forums
- Forwarding documents that contain eID signatures (yours or someone else's)
